# Changelog

This project follows Keep a Changelog and Semantic Versioning for plugin releases.

## [Unreleased]

- Harmonised carousel CSS variables by plugging theme tokens into controls/thumbs and dropping unused masonry inline var.


### Minor Changes
- Relax Lightbox overlay height to 100% to avoid gaps when scrolling stays enabled.
- Localize the “Lightbox2 Carousel” plugin label across all bundled languages.

- Initial release of the Django CMS plugin aligned with Lightbox2 v2.11.5 assets.
